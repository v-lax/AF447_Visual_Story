          On it's maiden voyage, the titanic was hailed by all as a ship that was completely 
          unsinkable, but we all know it to be one of histories greatest disasters. 
          Similarly, airplanes have gotten so advanced, that many have started to say the 
          same thing: that they are uncrashable. So how then did one of the most 
          sophistacted flying machines in the world crash into the atlantic ocean, 
          killing everyone on board. This project examines the events that 
          brought down Air France Flight 447

                <h3 class="fs-text-titles">Flight School - (FSCHL)</h3>
                Before we jump into the story and start examining 
                what happened, it is going to be extremely useful to 
                first understand the displays you see on the right hand 
                side of your screen. Take some time to hover over each section
                to learn more about what each display represents.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="2">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The most important display is the main pilot display. 
                This is what the pilot uses to fly when they can’t 
                see or have very low visibility. On the flight display 
                their are four main features
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="3">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The first feature is the speed indicator. This 
                simply displays the planes air speed in knots. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="4">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The second feature is what is know as an Altimeter. This displays
                the planes current height in feet. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="5">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The third and most important feature is what is called the attitude indicator.
                It displays the position of the nose of the plane in relation
                to the horizon. 
            </div>   
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="6">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The center dot on the attitude indicator represents the 
                actual nose of the plane. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="7">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The area in blue represents the sky, and the area in brown
                represents the ground.
            </div>
            <div class='text-scroll step' data-step="8">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                If the nose is pitched up, then you will
                see more blue.
            </div>
            <div class='text-scroll step' data-step="9">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                If the nose is pitched down, then you will see more brown.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="10">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                When the attitude indicator rotates to the left, that means that the plane
                is rolling to the right.  
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="11">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                If the attitude indicator is rotating to the right 
                that means that plane is rolling to the left. It seems very counter-intuitive
                but you must remember that this attitude indicator represents 
                the plane in relation to the horizon.
            </div>
            <section class="step"data-step="12">
                <div class="text-scroll">
                  <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The numbers on the attitude represent that angle of the airplane's 
                nose in relation to the horizon. So if the nose is at the 10 in the blue 
                area, that means that the airplanes nose is pitched 10 degrees up. 
                If the nose is at the 10 in the brown area then that means that the 
                airplane’s nose is pitched 10 degrees down.

              Now that you understand the basics, lets pick up the story and join
              flight 447 as it is cruising over the atlantic ocean.

            <h3 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO Checkpoint - Nothing out of the Ordinary</h3>
            Flight 447 is approaching ARARO point. The pilot flying is Cedric Bonin and his co-pilot is David Robert. 
            Bonin is sitting in the right seat and Robert is sitting in the left seat.  
            The captain, Marc Dubois is currently on his break in the crew quarters. 
        </div>
          <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="14">
            <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
            At this stage, the aircraft is flying level at an altitude of 35,000 feet... 
          </div>
          <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="15">
            <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
            and at a speed of Mach .82 (or cruising speed). 
          </div>
          <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="16">
            <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
            The pitch attitude or the angle of the nose of the airplane
            in relation to the horizon was 2.5 degrees and the angle of attack of
            the plane was 3 degrees.
          </div>
          <div class="text-scroll step" data-step='17'>
            <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
            And the auto-pilot is on. All normal and nothing out of the ordinary
            here.
          </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="18">
        <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
          The angle of attack is the angle at which the airplane wings meet the
          oncoming air. The higher the angle of attack the greater the lift
          efficiency, BUT (and this is a really really big but) only up to a
          certain point. If the angle attack exceeds a certain amount, the
          oncoming air can no longer smoothly flow over the top of the wing,
          decreasing lift, which causes the aircraft to go into what is known as
          a stall. This happens with all airplanes and has absolutely nothing to
          do with the engines. When a stall occurs, the airplane wings are at
          such a steep angle that the power and thrust provided by the engines
          of the plane can not exceed the drag forces experienced by the
          airplane. Now, the only way to exit a stall, is to do something that
          seems really counter-intuitive. You have to push the nose of the
          airplane down and dive, so that the oncoming air can begin to smoothly
          flow over the wing again, thereby producing lift and taking the
          airplane out of the stall.

                <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
                The aircraft is currently operating in what is known as
                “Normal Law”. Under this mode, the flight computers control a large
                portion of the “fly by wire” system we mentioned above. If for some reason
                the pilot makes side-stick inputs erraticly or by mistake, 
                The computer basically says, “Im in normal mode, and i just received an input that would be too dangerous
                for this altitude. Because this action would cause a stall at this
                altitude, I will restrict this input from the pilot and not allow it
                to go through.”

                It’s a great fail safe and has contributed a lot to
                why air travel is so safe these days. AF447 is currently operating
                under “Normal Law” and everything seems to be going ok, but not for
                long.

        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="20">
          <h3 class="ls-text-titles">Loss of Air Speed- LoAS</h3>
          Robert notices that they are headed towards an area of
          intensive activity and asks Bonin if he can move the aircraft left, so
          that they can dodge this activity. Bonin rolls the plane 20 degrees to
          the left and also reduces the airspeed from .82 mach to .8 mach. This
          slightly increased the angle of attack on the airplane. The sound of
          tiny ice crystals hitting the windshield of the aircraft could clearly
          be heard in the cockpit.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="18">
        <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
          Unknown to both pilots, these ice crystals were clogging up
          the airplane’s pitot tubes. The pitot tubes are located on the front
          of all major aircraft and are instruments that provide vital airspeed
          data to the aircraft’s computers. Because the ice crystals clogged up
          the pitot tubes, accurate air speed data stopped being sent to the
          flight computers, and without accurate airspeed data, AF447’s
          autopilot turned off, sounding an alarm in the cockpit, handing
          control of the aircraft fully over to the pilots. 
        </div>
        <section class="step"data-step="19">
            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                This also switched the mode on the flight computers from the existing “Normal Law” to
                “Alternate Law”. In alternate law, the pilot’s inputs are not as
                scrutinized by the flight computer as under “normal law”, which means
                that the flight computers can’t prevent any errors or prevent stalls
                from happening. 
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                Everything that just occurred was a normal and logical
                response by the airplane and was designed this way by the airplane
                engineers. At this moment, Bonin verbally says “I have the controls.”
              </div>
        </section>
        <section id="ap-loss" class="step" data-step="20">
            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                Now remember, the airplane is currently flying level (both
                wings and nose level to the horizon) and the engine thrust set to
                consistently deliver a nominal .8 mach. The only significant error was
                the loss of the indication of airspeed, not the actual airspeed
                itself. All Bonin needs to do is keep the aircraft straight and level
                and maintain these current conditions. 
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                As a result of the loss the auto pilot, the plane begins to roll slightly to the right. 
                To correct this all Bonin needs to do is move his side stick a little bit to the
                left to counteract the roll right. But for some unknown reason, Bonin
                makes a nose up and left input. 
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                Now its not a slight pulling back of the side stick. 
                Bonin jerks the side stick back considerably and to
                the left. Because Bonin makes this nose up and left input, an alarm
                (Altitude alert C cord) in the cockpit sounds warning the pilots that
                the aircraft has left its recommended altitude and has begun climbing
                because of Bonin’s nose up input. The airplane then sounds the stall
                warning twice in a row. Now remember, the plane’s computers are in
                alternate law so it is not going to correct Bonin’s mistake. Neither
                pilot acknowledges the altitude or stall warning.
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                The airplane is now climbing at a blistering rate, almost
                7000ft/minute. Both pilots acknowledge that they have lost their
                airspeed indications. But as the aircraft continues to climb it’s also
                losing a tremendous amount of speed. During the next ten seconds Bonin
                brings the pitch of the aircraft from 2.5 degrees to 11 degrees.
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                During these next ten seconds, Rober starts to read out the warning
                messages in a disorganized manner. He verbally says “Alternate Law
                Protections”, which means that the airplane has moved from normal to
                alternate law and that stalls can occur. But each time the stall
                warning sounds, both pilots seem to not acknowledge it at all. It’s
                not clear that Robert processed what he was reading from the screen or
                if Bonin ever heard anything that Robert was saying at this time.
                Because if they did, they would have acknowledged the stall warnings
                and instead of pulling up, Bonin could have pushed the nose of the
                plane down, to recover from the stall.
              </div>
        </section>
        <section id="almost-saved" class="step" data-step="21">

                <h3 class="al-text-titles">Almost Saved - ALSAV</h3>
                Robert tells Bonin, “Pay attention to your speed. Pay
                attention to your speed.” By this Robert probably means the vertical
                speed because their air speed is still currently invalid.

                <h5 class="al-text-titles">ALSAV</h5>

                we are going up.... Descend.”

              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="al-text-titles">ALSAV</h5>
                Now during this whole time, Robert has actually no
                idea whether or not Bonin is making the necessary side stick inputs.
                That is because Robert’s side stick and Bonin’s stick are not linked.
                This is how most Airbus aircraft are designed. If Bonin moves side
                stick, Robert’s side stick stays stationary. If both pilots move their
                side stick at the same time, then a warning sounds off saying “Dual
                Input”, and flight computers split the difference. 
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="al-text-titles">ALSAV</h5>
                If Bonin and Rober were flying a Boeing aircraft, they would both have what is called
                yolk. Its a long column that sits in front of the pilots seat. Now if
                one pilot moves his yolk or control column in a boeing, the other
                pilot’s yolk/control column would move as well because both are
                linked. Robert would be able to identify exactly what Bonin was doing.
                In this A330 that was unfortunately not the case.
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="al-text-titles">ALSAV</h5>
                Bonin eases back on the stick and for slight moment the
                aircraft begins to pick up some speed as the nose is lowered. A few
                degrees lower and Bonin can reduce the climb and get the aircraft back
                on track, but for some reason Bonin does not do this. He push back on
                the stick again.

                Even though the plane is actually beginning to level Bonin continues to make nose up inputs, 
                raising the pitch of the aircraft back up to 13 degrees above the horizon. 
                Again the stall warning sounds. The aircraft begins to shake violently.

                Not knowing what is happening, Robert makes a call to

                Bonin continues to make nose up inputs, raising the pitch of
                the aircraft to 13 degrees above the horizon. Again the stall warning
                sounds. The aircraft begins to shake violently.

                The aircraft reaches its maximum altitude of about 38,000
                feet. With the engine at full power and an angle of attack of 16
                degrees, the plane begins to decend and fall out of the sky. If Bonin
                just let go of the side stick, the plane’s pitch would decrease,
                increase the flow of air over the top of the wings, and pulling the
                plane out of the stall. But Bonin, doesnt let go and pulls and holds
                the side stick all the way back. At this time, the plane is shaking so
                much that it’s extremely difficult to keep the plane's wings level.

                We can never really know the true reason 
                Bonin kept pulling his side stick back, 
                but there are some possible explanations.

            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="dp-text-titles">DPSL</h5>
                One possible reason was that both pilot’s were more focused on leveling the plane, 
                trying to understand why the auto pilot was turned off and why they lost their airspeeds
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="dp-text-titles">DPSL</h5>
                Another reason may be that Bonin was trying to reach clear skys, by flying higher, 
                because they were at the edge of the cloud layer. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="dp-text-titles">DPSL</h5>
                And the last reason may include that the presence of turbulence prior to loss 
                of autopilot may have changed their perception of the planes movements.

                Robert takes control of the plane for a few seconds, without
                letting Bonin know that he was taking control. Almost immediately
                after Robert takes control of the plane, Bonin takes control back.

                Captain Dubois finally comes in the cockpit to see what is
                happening. Captain Dubois asks, “What the hell are you doing?”. And
                Bonin responds that they have lost control of the airplane.
              </div>

                The aircraft falls back down to it’s original altitude of
                35,000 feet but continues to descend at a rate of almost 10,000ft/min.
                At this moment the stall warning stopped sounding because the angle of
                attack was so high that the flight computers rejected the data as
                invalid. The recorded angle of attack was an incredible 41 degrees.
              </div> 
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="cf-text-titles">CFUS</h5>
                The right wing was down by about 30 degrees causing the plane to arc
                way off its set flight path. The aircraft would maintain these
                characteristics all the way till it hit the Atlantic ocean.
             </div>
             <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="cf-text-titles">CFUS</h5>
                Now because the stall warning had stopped sounding, the
                pilots may have assumed that all was ok again (when in reality things
                were not ok). Each time bonin actually did lower the nose of the
                plane, the computer began to receive accurate data again and the stall
                warning began to sound. Thinking that he was in stall again Bonin then
                pulled back on his side stick, increasing the pitch of the plane, and
                increasing the angle of attack, such that the computer rejected the
                data being provided, and the stall warning stopped. This was a
                nightmarish negative feedback loop. The plane was now loosing altitude
                at a rate of 15,000ft/min/

                Robert asks Captain Dubois, “What do you think? What do you

                Captain Dubois says, “I don’t know.” Captain Dubois urges
                Bonin to level the wings but that does extremely little to solve their
                actual problem.

          Robert quickly takes back control, pitches the nose of the
          airplane down, but as he does that Bonin pushes the nose of the plane
          up. The Dual Input warning sounds again and the plane maintains a
          upward pitch. Bonin says, “We are reaching flight level 100.” , which
          means their current altitude is 10,000ft. This was the last moment in
          which a recovery would have been possible. There are only a handful of
          pilots who would have been able to execute the maneuver necessary to
          save this plane.

                Robert tells Bonin, “Climb, Climb, Climb…”. Bonin responds,
                “But I have had my stick back this whole time!”. To this Captain
                Dubois says, “No, do not climb!”. What Captain Dubois meant to say was
                “Do not pitch up!” because it was because their high pitch that they
                were falling out of the sky. They actually needed to “climb”.
