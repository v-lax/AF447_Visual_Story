          On May 31st, 2009 216 passengers and 12 flight crew boarded Air France
          flight 447 on route to Paris Charles de Gaulle from Rio de Janeiro.
          None of these individuals would ever make it to their final
          destination. The crash sent shockwaves throughout the aviation world.
          Everyone was dumbfounded by the idea that a plane as sophisticated and
          advanced as the A330, and a crew as experienced as the one onboard
          AF447, could crash into the Atlantic ocean. The following examines
          what led AF447 to crash into the Atlantic ocean, killing all 228
          individuals on board.

                <h3 class="fs-text-titles">Flight School - (FSCHL)</h3>
                Before we jump into the story and start examining 
                what happened, it is going to be extremely useful to 
                first understand the displays you see on the right hand 
                side of your screen as well as understand how airplanes 
                work. Let’s start with the displays.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="3">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                First we have waypoints. A waypoint is just a set of coordinates that refers 
                to the plane’s position along a path. 
                Pilots use waypoints to navigate to the final destination 
                and use it to communicate with air traffic control along the flight 
                path. We will use it to represent your progress throughout this 
                story
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="4">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                Second we have our main pilot display. 
                This is what the pilot uses to fly when they can’t 
                see or have very low visibility. On the flight display 
                their are four main features
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="5">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The first feature is the speed indicator. This 
                simply displays the planes air speed in knots. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="6">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The second feature is what is know as an Altimeter. This displays
                the planes current height in feet. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="7">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The third and most important feature is what is called the attitude indicator.
                It displays the position of the nose of the plane in relation
                to the horizon. 
            </div>   
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="8">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The center dot on the attitude indicator represents the 
                actual nose of the plane. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="9">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The area in blue represents the sky, and the area in brown
                represents the ground.
            </div>
            <div class='text-scroll step' data-step="10">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                If the nose is pitched up, then you will
                see more blue.
            </div>
            <div class='text-scroll step' data-step="11">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                If the nose is pitched down, then you will see more brown.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="12">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                When the attitude indicator rotates to the left, that means that the plane
                is rolling to the right.  
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="13">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                If the attitude indicator is rotating to the right 
                that means that plane is rolling to the left. It seems very counter-intuitive
                but you must remember that this attitude indicator represents 
                the plane in relation to the horizon.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="14">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The numbers on the attitude represent that angle of the airplane's 
                nose in relation to the horizon. So if the nose is at the 10 in the blue 
                area, that means that the airplanes nose is pitched 10 degrees up. 
                If the nose is at the 10 in the brown area then that means that the 
                airplane’s nose is pitched 10 degrees down.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="15">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                Now that we have reviewed the pilot display, let's finish up with the 
                rest of the sections. The next section is our main media display. nothing
                to complicated here. We'll use this display to render a 3D version of the plane
                so you can understand whats going on, as well as use to display other media
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="16">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                In the bottom left hand corner, we have our ECAM message alert. 
                ECAM stands for Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor. This displays
                important warnings and messages to the pilots as they are flying.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="17">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                And last but not least we have our side stick displays. The side-stick is 
                what the pilot uses to control the airplane. Both pilots have their own
                side-stick. The display on the left represents the side-stick of the 
                pilot sitting in the left seat of the cockpit. And the display on the 
                right represents the side-stick of the pilot sitting in the right seat. 
                Each display contains a circle at the center. The circle represents the position
                of the side-stick.
             </div>
             <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="18">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                Now that we know what each of the displays mean, we next have to understand
                how airplanes get up into the air and stay there.
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="19">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                The first concept I want to focus on is lift. Lift (and a combination
                of a few other items) is what helps a 230 ton piece of metal get up
                into the sky. In order to understand lift, we will focus on a key component of any airplane or
                creature that can fly, the wings. The shape of the wing is what is
                known as an airfoil. This shape causes the pressure at the bottom of
                the wing to be higher than the pressure at the top of the wing. This
                pressure difference creates a lift force. And if our lift force is
                greater than the gravitational force pulling down on our plane, then
                our plane is going to climb and increase in altitude.
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="20">
                <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                Now we have got our plane into the sky. How do we keep it in the air
                and keep the plane moving forward? Our plane stays in the air,
                constantly moving forward because there is 0 net force acting on the
                plane. What does that mean? Well, there are 4 main forces acting on an
                airplane as it is moving through the sky. It experiences a
                gravitational force (the force pulling the plane toward the ground), a
                lift force (the force pushing the plane up and away from the ground),
                a thrust force (the force created by the engines propelling the plane
                forward), and a drag force (force slowing the plane down as it moves
                forward and hits air particles). If all these forces are equal and
                cancel each other out then our plane will stay in the sky and stay in
                motion. This is basically Newton’s third law of motion, an object in
                motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest.

                    <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                    Now that we know how a plane stays in the sky, we can look at how a
                    pilot is able to steer it. The cockpit of an Airbus A330, the type of
                    airplane that AF447 was, has a flight control system known as “fly by
                    wire”. If you can recall from our brief introduction above, each pilot has a side stick they
                    use to control the airplane. In a fly by wire system, inputs to the side stick (this video
                    game-like controller) are converted to electronic signals and
                    transmitted through wires and sent to the flight computers. The flight
                    control computers determine how to move control surfaces on the
                    wings,tail, or elevator. 
                  </div>
                  <div class="text-scroll">
                    <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                    There are three main axes in which an airplane can move. These three main axes are known as pitch, yaw, and
                    roll. Forward and backwards movements of the side-stick control the pitch of the airplane.
                    Pitch moves the nose of the airplane up and down and is
                    controlled adjusting the flaps on the elevator of the plane. 
                  </div>
                  <div class="text-scroll">
                    <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                    Each pilot has foot pedals that they use to control the yaw of the plane.
                    Yaw moves the nose of the airplane left and right and is controlled by adjusting
                    the flaps on the tail of the plane. 
                  </div>
                  <div class="text-scroll">
                    <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                    Left and Right movements of the side-stick control the roll of the plane.
                    And roll, moves the airplane along the axis running from the nose to the tail of an airplane, and is
                    controlled by the flaps located on both of the main wings.

                    <h5 class="fs-text-titles">FSCHL</h5>
                    Now that you understand some basic concepts of how planes fly, Let’s 
                    dive a little bit deeper into the incidents that occured during the crash
                    of AF447. 
                  </div>
              </section>
        </section>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="22">
            <h3 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO Point - ARARO</h3>
            We will pick up the story as AF447 is approaching ARARO point. 
            The pilot flying is Cedric Bonin and his co-pilot is David Robert. 
            Bonin is sitting in the right seat and Robert is sitting in the left seat.  
            The captain, Marc Dubois is currently on his break in the crew quarters. 
        </div>  
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="23">
          <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
          At this stage, the aircraft is flying level at an altitude of 35,000 feet at a speed of
          Mach .82. The pitch attitude or the angle of the nose of the airplane
          in relation to the horizon was 2.5 degrees and the angle of attack of
          the plane was 3 degrees. All normal and nothing out of the ordinary
          here.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="24">
        <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
          The angle of attack is the angle at which the airplane wings meet the
          oncoming air. The higher the angle of attack the greater the lift
          efficiency, BUT (and this is a really really big but) only up to a
          certain point. If the angle attack exceeds a certain amount, the
          oncoming air can no longer smoothly flow over the top of the wing,
          decreasing lift, which causes the aircraft to go into what is known as
          a stall. This happens with all airplanes and has absolutely nothing to
          do with the engines. When a stall occurs, the airplane wings are at
          such a steep angle that the power and thrust provided by the engines
          of the plane can not exceed the drag forces experienced by the
          airplane. Now, the only way to exit a stall, is to do something that
          seems really counter-intuitive. You have to push the nose of the
          airplane down and dive, so that the oncoming air can begin to smoothly
          flow over the wing again, thereby producing lift and taking the
          airplane out of the stall.
        </div>
        <section class="step"data-step="25">
            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ar-text-titles">ARARO</h5>
                The aircraft is currently operating in what is known as
                “Normal Law”. Under this mode, the flight computers control a large
                portion of the “fly by wire” system we mentioned above. If for some reason
                the pilot makes side-stick inputs erraticly or by mistake, 
                The computer basically says, “Im in normal mode, and i just received an input that would be too dangerous
                for this altitude. Because this action would cause a stall at this
                altitude, I will restrict this input from the pilot and not allow it
                to go through.” 
              </div>

                It’s a great fail safe and has contributed a lot to
                why air travel is so safe these days. AF447 is currently operating
                under “Normal Law” and everything seems to be going ok, but not for
                long.

        </section>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="26">
          <h3 class="ls-text-titles">Loss of Air Speed- LoAS</h3>
          Robert notices that they are headed towards an area of
          intensive activity and asks Bonin if he can move the aircraft left, so
          that they can dodge this activity. Bonin rolls the plane 20 degrees to
          the left and also reduces the airspeed from .82 mach to .8 mach. This
          slightly increased the angle of attack on the airplane. The sound of
          tiny ice crystals hitting the windshield of the aircraft could clearly
          be heard in the cockpit.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="27">
        <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
          Unknown to both pilots, these ice crystals were clogging up
          the airplane’s pitot tubes. The pitot tubes are located on the front
          of all major aircraft and are instruments that provide vital airspeed
          data to the aircraft’s computers. Because the ice crystals clogged up
          the pitot tubes, accurate air speed data stopped being sent to the
          flight computers, and without accurate airspeed data, AF447’s
          autopilot turned off, sounding an alarm in the cockpit, handing
          control of the aircraft fully over to the pilots.

                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                This also switched the mode on the flight computers from the existing “Normal Law” to
                “Alternate Law”. In alternate law, the pilot’s inputs are not as
                scrutinized by the flight computer as under “normal law”, which means
                that the flight computers can’t prevent any errors or prevent stalls
                from happening.

                Everything that just occurred was a normal and logical
                response by the airplane and was designed this way by the airplane

                Now remember, the airplane is currently flying level (both
                wings and nose level to the horizon) and the engine thrust set to
                consistently deliver a nominal .8 mach. The only significant error was
                the loss of the indication of airspeed, not the actual airspeed
                itself. All Bonin needs to do is keep the aircraft straight and level
                and maintain these current conditions. 
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                As a result of the loss the auto pilot, the plane begins to roll slightly to the right. 
                To correct this all Bonin needs to do is move his side stick a little bit to the
                left to counteract the roll right. But for some unknown reason, Bonin
                makes a nose up and left input. 
              </div>
              <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                Now its not a slight pulling back of the side stick. 
                Bonin jerks the side stick back considerably and to
                the left. Because Bonin makes this nose up and left input, an alarm
                (Altitude alert C cord) in the cockpit sounds warning the pilots that
                the aircraft has left its recommended altitude and has begun climbing
                because of Bonin’s nose up input. The airplane then sounds the stall
                warning twice in a row. Now remember, the plane’s computers are in
                alternate law so it is not going to correct Bonin’s mistake. Neither
                pilot acknowledges the altitude or stall warning.

                The airplane is now climbing at a blistering rate, almost
                7000ft/minute. Both pilots acknowledge that they have lost their
                airspeed indications. But as the aircraft continues to climb it’s also
                losing a tremendous amount of speed. During the next ten seconds Bonin
                brings the pitch of the aircraft from 2.5 degrees to 11 degrees.

                <h5 class="ls-text-titles">LoAS</h5>
                During these next ten seconds, Rober starts to read out the warning
                messages in a disorganized manner. He verbally says “Alternate Law
                Protections”, which means that the airplane has moved from normal to
                alternate law and that stalls can occur. But each time the stall
                warning sounds, both pilots seem to not acknowledge it at all. It’s
                not clear that Robert processed what he was reading from the screen or
                if Bonin ever heard anything that Robert was saying at this time.
                Because if they did, they would have acknowledged the stall warnings
                and instead of pulling up, Bonin could have pushed the nose of the
                plane down, to recover from the stall.

                Robert tells Bonin, “Pay attention to your speed. Pay
                attention to your speed.” By this Robert probably means the vertical
                speed because their air speed is still currently invalid.

                Now during this whole time, Robert has actually no
                idea whether or not Bonin is making the necessary side stick inputs.
                That is because Robert’s side stick and Bonin’s stick are not linked.
                This is how most Airbus aircraft are designed. If Bonin moves side
                stick, Robert’s side stick stays stationary. If both pilots move their
                side stick at the same time, then a warning sounds off saying “Dual
                Input”, and flight computers split the difference.

                If Bonin and Rober were flying a Boeing aircraft, they would both have what is called
                yolk. Its a long column that sits in front of the pilots seat. Now if
                one pilot moves his yolk or control column in a boeing, the other
                pilot’s yolk/control column would move as well because both are
                linked. Robert would be able to identify exactly what Bonin was doing.
                In this A330 that was unfortunately not the case.

                Bonin eases back on the stick and for slight moment the
                aircraft begins to pick up some speed as the nose is lowered. A few
                degrees lower and Bonin can reduce the climb and get the aircraft back
                on track, but for some reason Bonin does not do this. He push back on
                the stick again.

                Even though the plane is actually beginning to level Bonin continues to make nose up inputs, 
                raising the pitch of the aircraft back up to 13 degrees above the horizon.

                The aircraft reaches its maximum altitude of about 38,000
                feet. With the engine at full power and an angle of attack of 16
                degrees, the plane begins to decend and fall out of the sky. If Bonin
                just let go of the side stick, the plane’s pitch would decrease,
                increase the flow of air over the top of the wings, and pulling the
                plane out of the stall. But Bonin, doesnt let go and pulls and holds
                the side stick all the way back. At this time, the plane is shaking so
                much that it’s extremely difficult to keep the plane's wings level.

                We can never really know the true reason 
                Bonin kept pulling his side stick back, 
                but there are some possible explanations.

            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="dp-text-titles">DPSL</h5>
                One possible reason was that both pilot’s were more focused on leveling the plane, 
                trying to understand why the auto pilot was turned off and why they lost their airspeeds

            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="dp-text-titles">DPSL</h5>
                Another reason may be that Bonin was trying to reach clear skys, by flying higher, 
                because they were at the edge of the cloud layer. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-scroll">
                <h5 class="dp-text-titles">DPSL</h5>
                And the last reason may include that the presence of turbulence prior to loss 
                of autopilot may have changed their perception of the planes movements.

                happening. Captain Dubois asks, “What the hell are you doing?”. And
                Bonin responds that they have lost control of the airplane.

                35,000 feet but continues to descend at a rate of almost 10,000ft/min.
                At this moment the stall warning stopped sounding because the angle of
                attack was so high that the flight computers rejected the data as
                invalid. The recorded angle of attack was an incredible 41 degrees.

                The right wing was down by about 30 degrees causing the plane to arc
                way off its set flight path. The aircraft would maintain these
                characteristics all the way till it hit the Atlantic ocean.

                Now because the stall warning had stopped sounding, the
                pilots may have assumed that all was ok again (when in reality things
                were not ok). Each time bonin actually did lower the nose of the
                plane, the computer began to receive accurate data again and the stall
                warning began to sound. Thinking that he was in stall again Bonin then
                pulled back on his side stick, increasing the pitch of the plane, and
                increasing the angle of attack, such that the computer rejected the
                data being provided, and the stall warning stopped. This was a
                nightmarish negative feedback loop. The plane was now loosing altitude
                at a rate of 15,000ft/min/

          upward pitch. Bonin says, “We are reaching flight level 100.” , which
          means their current altitude is 10,000ft. This was the last moment in
          which a recovery would have been possible. There are only a handful of
