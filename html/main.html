          <h2>The Crash of Air France Flight 447</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="1">
          On May 31st, 2009 216 passengers and 12 flight crew boarded Air France
          flight 447 on route to Paris Charles de Gaulle from Rio de Janeiro.
          None of these individuals would ever make it to their final
          destination. The crash sent shockwaves throughout the aviation world.
          Everyone was dumbfounded by the idea that a plane as sophisticated and
          advanced as the A330, and a crew as experienced as the one onboard
          AF447, could crash into the Atlantic ocean. The following examines
          what led AF447 to crash into the Atlantic ocean, killing all 228
          individuals on board.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="2">
          Before we jump into the story and start examining what happened, it is
          going to be extremely useful to first understand how airplanes work.
          There are three main concepts that we will cover. These concepts will
          help you understand the pilots actions and how that impacts the
          airplane. These concepts are by no means exhaustive. Airplane
          aerodynamics are extremely complicated but having this basic
          understanding will help as we walk through this story.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="3">
          The first concept I want to focus on is lift. Lift (and a combination
          of a few other items) is what helps a 230 ton piece of metal get up
          into the sky. It’s also what allows birds to fly. In order to
          understand lift, we will focus on a key component of any airplane or
          creature that can fly, the wings. The shape of the wing is what is
          known as an airfoil. This shape causes the pressure at the bottom of
          the wing to be higher than the pressure at the top of the wing. This
          pressure difference creates a lift force. And if our lift force is
          greater than the gravitational force pulling down on our plane, then
          our plane is going to climb and increase in altitude.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="4">
          Now we have got our plane into the sky. How do we keep it in the air
          and keep the plane moving forward? Our plane stays in the air,
          constantly moving forward because there is 0 net force acting on the
          plane. What does that mean? Well, there are 4 main forces acting on an
          airplane as it is moving through the sky. It experiences a
          gravitational force (the force pulling the plane toward the ground), a
          lift force (the force pushing the plane up and away from the ground),
          a thrust force (the force created by the engines propelling the plane
          forward), and a drag force (force slowing the plane down as it moves
          forward and hits air particles). If all these forces are equal and
          cancel each other out then our plane will stay in the sky and stay in
          motion. This is basically Newton’s third law of motion, an object in
          motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="5">
          Now that we know how a plane stays in the sky, we can look at how a
          pilot is able to steer it. The cockpit of an Airbus A330, the type of
          airplane that AF447 was, has a flight control system known as “fly by
          wire”. If you look in the cockpit you will see that next to both pilot
          seats there are what look like a video game controller. This is known
          as the “side-stick” and is what the pilot uses to steer the airplane.
          In a fly by wire system, inputs to the side stick (this video
          game-like controller) are converted to electronic signals and
          transmitted through wires and sent to the flight computers. The flight
          control computers determine how to move control surfaces on the
          wings,tail, or elevator. There are three main axes in which an
          airplane can move. These three main axes are known as pitch, yaw, and
          roll. Pitch moves the nose of the airplane up and down and is
          controlled adjusting the flaps on the elevator of the plane. Yaw moves
          the nose of the airplane left and right and is controlled by adjusting
          the flaps on the tail of the plane. And roll, moves the airplane along
          the axis running from the nose to the tail of an airplane, and is
          controlled by the flaps located on both of the main wings.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="6">
          01:35:00 - We will pick up our story at 1 hour and 35 minutes. The
          Captain, Marc Dubois, is pilot not flying (PNF), and is sitting in the
          left seat in the cockpit. First officer, Pierre Cedric Bonin, is pilot
          flying (PF), and is sitting in the right seat in the cockpit. Because
          this is a long haul flight, there was also a second First officer,
          David Robert, who was outside of the cockpit in the crew quarters, on
          his break. The airplane arrives at INTOL point. INTOL point is what is
          known as a waypoint. A waypoint is just a set of coordinates that
          refers to the plane’s position along a path. Pilots use waypoints to
          navigate to the final destination and use it to communicate with air
          traffic control along the flight path.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="7">
          A few moments later Bonin (PF), modifies scale on his flight display.
          After adjusting the display, Bonin notes “...a thing straight ahead”.
          Captain Dubois confirms. Unlike most other flights flying through the
          area at that time, the pilots of AF447 have not updated their flight
          path to avoid the worst of the storms. The air outside of the aircraft
          is also unusually warm (still really cold but 12 degrees warmer than
          usual) and this prevents the aircraft from climbing to avoid the
          inclement weather. So instead they charge head on into a group of
          clouds.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="8">
          01:51:00 - As they entered this cloud layer the crew dimmed the
          lighting in the cockpit and turned on the headlights “to see” what was
          ahead of them. The cockpit also became illuminated by a strange
          natural phenomena known as “St.Elmos Fire”. It occurs at high
          altitudes with thunderstorms, and occurs because the surrounding air
          particles become statically charged.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="9">
          2:00:00 - At this moment, Captain Dubois leaves the cockpit to get
          some rest and first officer David Robert, takes his spot as PNF in the
          left seat of the cockpit. At this stage, the aircraft has just crossed
          SALPU point and has entered the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This
          is an area near the equator that is infamous for having severe
          thunderstorms. Bonin makes a call to one of the flight attendants
          informing them that they should expect some rough turbulence in a few
          minutes, and that he would call back once they were out of it. Bonin
          never makes the call back.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="10">
          2:04:00 - The airplane is approaching ARARO point. At this stage, the
          aircraft is flying level at an altitude of 35,000 feet at a speed of
          Mach .82. The pitch attitude or the angle of the nose of the airplane
          in relation to the horizon was 2.5 degrees and the angle of attack of
          the plane was 3 degrees. All normal and nothing out of the ordinary
          here.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="11">
          The angle of attack is the angle at which the airplane wings meet the
          oncoming air. The higher the angle of attack the greater the lift
          efficiency, BUT (and this is a really really big but) only up to a
          certain point. If the angle attack exceeds a certain amount, the
          oncoming air can no longer smoothly flow over the top of the wing,
          decreasing lift, which causes the aircraft to go into what is known as
          a stall. This happens with all airplanes and has absolutely nothing to
          do with the engines. When a stall occurs, the airplane wings are at
          such a steep angle that the power and thrust provided by the engines
          of the plane can not exceed the drag forces experienced by the
          airplane. The aircraft then enters a nose high descent straight into
          the ground. Now, the only way to exit a stall, is to do something that
          seems really counter-intuitive. You have to push the nose of the
          airplane down and dive, so that the oncoming air can begin to smoothly
          flow over the wing again, thereby producing lift and taking the
          airplane out of the stall.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="12">
          2:00:05 - The aircraft is currently operating in what is known as
          “Normal Law”. Under this mode, the flight computers control a large
          portion of the “fly by wire” system we mentioned above. If for some
          reason the pilot does something by mistake and pulls the side stick
          back, pushing the nose of the airplane up, normal law actually
          prevents this input from fully being translated to changes on the
          control surfaces on the plane. The computer basically says, “Im in
          normal mode, and i just received an input that would be too dangerous
          for this altitude. Because this action would cause a stall at this
          altitude, I will restrict this input from the pilot and not allow it
          to go through.” It’s a great fail safe and has contributed a lot to
          why air travel is so safe these days. AF447 is currently operating
          under “Normal Law” and everything seems to be going ok, but not for
          long.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="13">
          2:08:00 - Robert notices that they are headed towards an area of
          intensive activity and asks Bonin if he can move the aircraft left, so
          that they can dodge this activity. Bonin rolls the plane 20 degrees to
          the left and also reduces the airspeed from .82 mach to .8 mach. This
          slightly increased the angle of attack on the airplane. The sound of
          tiny ice crystals hitting the windshield of the aircraft could clearly
          be heard in the cockpit.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="14">
          2:10:05 - Unknown to both pilots, these ice crystals were clogging up
          the airplane’s pitot tubes. The pitot tubes are located on the front
          of all major aircraft and are instruments that provide vital airspeed
          data to the aircraft’s computers. Because the ice crystals clogged up
          the pitot tubes, accurate air speed data stopped being sent to the
          flight computers, and without accurate airspeed data, AF447’s
          autopilot turned off, sounding an alarm in the cockpit, handing
          control of the aircraft fully over to the pilots. This also switched
          the mode on the flight computers from the existing “Normal Law” to
          “Alternate Law”. In alternate law, the pilot’s inputs are not as
          scrutinized by the flight computer as under “normal law”, which means
          that the flight computers can’t prevent any errors or prevent stalls
          from happening. Everything that just occurred was a normal and logical
          response by the airplane and was designed this way by the airplane
          engineers. At this moment, Bonin verbally says “I have the controls.”
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="15">
          2:10:07 - Now remember, the airplane is currently flying level (both
          wings and nose level to the horizon) and the engine thrust set to
          consistently deliver a nominal .8 mach. The only significant error was
          the loss of the indication of airspeed, not the actual airspeed
          itself. All Bonin needs to do is keep the aircraft straight and level
          and maintain these current conditions. As Bonin takes control, he
          realizes the plane begins to roll slightly to the right and to correct
          it all Bonin needs to do is move his side stick a little bit to the
          left to counteract the roll right. But for some unknown reason, Bonin
          makes a nose up and left input. Now its not a slight pulling back of
          the side stick. Bonin jerks the side stick back considerably and to
          the left. Because Bonin makes this nose up and left input, an alarm
          (Altitude alert C cord) in the cockpit sounds warning the pilots that
          the aircraft has left its recommended altitude and has begun climbing
          because of Bonin’s nose up input. The airplane then sounded the stall
          warning twice in a row. Now remember, the plane’s computers are in
          alternate law so it is not going to correct Bonin’s mistake. Neither
          pilot acknowledged the altitude or stall warning.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="16">
          2:10:16 - The airplane is now climbing at a blistering rate, almost
          7000ft/minute. Both pilots acknowledge that they have lost their
          airspeed indications. But as the aircraft continues to climb it’s also
          losing a tremendous amount of speed. During the next ten seconds Bonin
          brings the pitch of the aircraft from 2.5 degrees to 11 degrees.
          During these next ten seconds, Rober starts to read out the warning
          messages in a disorganized manner. He verbally says “Alternate Law
          Protections”, which means that the airplane has moved from normal to
          alternate law and that stalls can occur. But each time the stall
          warning sounds, both pilots seem to not acknowledge it at all. It’s
          not clear that Robert processed what he was reading from the screen or
          if Bonin ever heard anything that Robert was saying at this time.
          Because if they did, they would have acknowledged the stall warnings
          and instead of pulling up, Bonin could have pushed the nose of the
          plane down, to recover from the stall.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="17">
          2:10:27 - Robert tells Bonin, “Pay attention to your speed. Pay
          attention to your speed.” By this Robert probably means the vertical
          speed because their air speed is still currently invalid.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="18">
          2:10:28 - Bonin responds, “Ok, ok, I am descending...”
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="19">
          2:10:31- Robert tells Bonin, “Decend… It says we are going up… It says
          we are going up.... Descend.”
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="20">
          2:10:36 - The pitot tube on the left side of the aircraft finally
          becomes unclogged and begins working again. This means that Robert,
          the pilot sitting in the left seat has accurate air speed indications
          on his display. Now during this whole time, Robert has actually no
          idea whether or not Bonin is making the necessary side stick inputs.
          That is because Robert’s side stick and Bonin’s stick are not linked.
          This is how most Airbus aircraft are designed. If Bonin moves side
          stick, Robert’s side stick stays stationary. If both pilots move their
          side stick at the same time, then a warning sounds off saying “Dual
          Input”, and flight computers split the difference. If Bonin and Rober
          were flying a Boeing aircraft, they would both have what is called
          yolk. Its a long column that sits in front of the pilots seat. Now if
          one pilot moves his yolk or control column in a boeing, the other
          pilot’s yolk/control column would move as well because both are
          linked. Robert would be able to identify exactly what Bonin was doing.
          In this A330 that was unfortunately not the case.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="21">
          2:10:38- Bonin eases back on the stick and for slight moment the
          aircraft begins to pick up some speed as the nose is lowered. A few
          degrees lower and Bonin can reduce the climb and get the aircraft back
          on track, but for some reason Bonin does not do this. He push back on
          the stick again.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="22">
          2:10:41 - not knowing what is happening, Robert makes a call to
          Captain Dubois asking him to come to cockpit immediately.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="23">
          2:10:51 - Bonin continues to make nose up inputs, raising the pitch of
          the aircraft to 13 degrees above the horizon. Again the stall warning
          sounds. The aircraft begins to shake violently.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="24">
          2:10:55 - The stall warning continues sound. The thrust levers are
          positioned in the TO/GA detent. TO/GA stands for take off/go around.
          Now the reason the thrust is at this position is because this is the
          setting used by pilots during take offs and go arounds (when they need
          to abort a landing), when they need to increase altitude and speed
          efficiently. Only issues is that this only works at low altitudes near
          sea level, NOT AT CRUISING altitude. At this altitude where the air is
          much thinner, engines generate less thrust and the wings produce much
          less left. About a few seconds later the air speed indication on
          Bonin’s display became valid again. After this point, it was all pilot
          error.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="25">
          2:11:06 - The aircraft reaches its maximum altitude of about 38,000
          feet. With the engine at full power and an angle of attack of 16
          degrees, the plane begins to decend and fall out of the sky. If Bonin
          just let go of the side stick, the plane’s pitch would decrease,
          increase the flow of air over the top of the wings, and pulling the
          plane out of the stall. But Bonin, doesnt let go and pulls and holds
          the side stick all the way back. At this time, the plane is shaking so
          much that it’s extremely difficult to keep the plane's wings level.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="26">
          2:11:37 - Robert takes control of the plane for a few seconds, without
          letting Bonin know that he was taking control. Almost immediately
          after Robert takes control of the plane, Bonin takes control back.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="27">
          2:11:42 - Captain Dubois finally comes in the cockpit to see what is
          happening. Captain Dubois asks, “What the hell are you doing?”. And
          Bonin responds that they have lost control of the airplane.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="28">
          2:11:47 - The aircraft falls back down to it’s original altitude of
          35,000 feet but continues to descend at a rate of almost 10,000ft/min.
          At this moment the stall warning stopped sounding because the angle of
          attack was so high that the flight computers rejected the data as
          invalid. The recorded angle of attack was an incredible 41 degrees.
          The right wing was down by about 30 degrees causing the plane to arc
          way off its set flight path. The aircraft would maintain these
          characteristics all the way till it hit the Atlantic ocean.
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="29">
          2:12:02 - Now because the stall warning had stopped sounding, the
          pilots may have assumed that all was ok again (when in reality things
          were not ok). Each time bonin actually did lower the nose of the
          plane, the computer began to receive accurate data again and the stall
          warning began to sound. Thinking that he was in stall again Bonin then
          pulled back on his side stick, increasing the pitch of the plane, and
          increasing the angle of attack, such that the computer rejected the
          data being provided, and the stall warning stopped. This was a
          nightmarish negative feedback loop. The plane was now loosing altitude
          at a rate of 15,000ft/min/
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="30">
          2:12:14 - Robert asks Captain Dubois, “What do you think? What do you
          think? What should we do?”
        </div>
        <div class="text-scroll step" data-step="31">
          2:12:15- Captain Dubois says, “I don’t know.” Captain Dubois urges
          Bonin to level the wings but that does extremely little to solve their
          actual problem.
        </div>

          2:13:32 - Robert quickly takes back control, pitches the nose of the
          airplane down, but as he does that Bonin pushes the nose of the plane
          up. The Dual Input warning sounds again and the plane maintains a
          upward pitch. Bonin says, “We are reaching flight level 100.” , which
          means their current altitude is 10,000ft. This was the last moment in
          which a recovery would have been possible. There are only a handful of
          pilots who would have been able to execute the maneuver necessary to
          save this plane.

          2:13:40 - Robert tells Bonin, “Climb, Climb, Climb…”. Bonin responds,
          “But I have had my stick back this whole time!”. To this Captain
          Dubois says, “No, do not climb!”. What Captain Dubois meant to say was
          “Do not pitch up!” because it was because their high pitch that they
          were falling out of the sky. They actually needed to “climb”.

          2:14:17 - The ground proximity warning system began to sound because
          it detected the ocean was fast approaching. Warning of “Sink Rate” and
          “Pull Up” began to sound.
